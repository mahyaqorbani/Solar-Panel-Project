# Solar-Panel-Project

Advanced Signal Decomposition in Solar Panels

This is a solar panel project in collaboration with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Department
of Energy (DOE). Our primary goal was to develop an optimization model capable of decomposing signals from
solar panels into distinct components, including soiling, degradation, seasonality, and noise. Our team successfully
introduced a novel methodology that surpassed existing benchmarks in performance. Currently, we are focused on
further improving the modelâ€™s accuracy and expanding its capabilities to incorporate additional components, thereby
enhancing its overall utility and impact. (Ongoing)
